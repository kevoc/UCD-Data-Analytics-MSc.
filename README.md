# UCD Data Analytics MSc.

This repository contains code and assignments I have completed as part of the [UCD Data Analytics Masters](http://www.ucd.ie/mathstat/study/graduatestudy/dataanalytics/) Program. I hope it is of use to anyone currently enrolled in this, or a similar course.

___Note:___ I will only be posting my personal work undertaken during the program. 
I will __not__ be posting any of the assignments, lecture notes, exam papers or other course material.
I will, however, provide an overview of the assignment or task in the __README__ file for any code posted. This will only be a high level interpretation, to put the code into context.


## Course Overview
The Masters program was delivered online over a 3-year period, with 6 on-campus examinations per year.
